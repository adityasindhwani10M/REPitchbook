# REPitchbook

REPitch Book is an AI-powered real estate pitching platform that helps brokers turn property details into professional, investor-ready pitches in minutes.

Brokers upload basic property information, get a structured, consulting-style pitch generated by AI, and retain full control by editing or refining every section before publishing.

On the buyer side, these pitches are presented in a swipe-based interface—similar to a dating app—allowing buyers to quickly express interest or pass, dramatically reducing time spent on irrelevant listings.

Short Version:-
REPitch Book uses AI to help real estate brokers instantly create professional, editable property pitches, and presents them to buyers in a swipe-based interface so interest is captured faster and more efficiently.
